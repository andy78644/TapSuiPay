# Cleanup Summary - May 21, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the final cleanup efforts to complete the transition from zkLogin to direct wallet integration with Face ID authentication.

## Completed Actions

### Code Files Updated:
1. **NFCService.swift**
   - Removed zkLoginService and blockchainService dependencies
   - Added proper TransactionService and WalletManager dependencies
   - Updated all transaction methods to use the new services
   - Changed authentication flow to use Face ID verification

2. **Configuration.swift**
   - Updated Auth struct keys to replace zkLogin references
   - Changed saltStorageKey to walletSecureData for proper wallet storage

### Documentation Updated:
1. **README.md**
   - Updated all references from zkLogin to Face ID authentication
   - Maintained the same user flow explanation with updated security descriptions

2. **CleanupLog.md**
   - Documented all additional cleanup efforts
   - Added details about the NFCService and Configuration changes

## Verification
- All Swift files have been verified to be free of zkLogin references
- All documentation has been updated to reflect the new authentication method
- The app now consistently refers to Face ID for wallet protection instead of zkLogin

## Next Steps
The refactoring is now complete from a code perspective. The next steps involve:

1. End-to-end testing with real devices to verify:
   - Face ID authentication flow works properly
   - Wallet creation and import functionality works as expected
   - Transaction signing with biometric verification is seamless
   - Google sign-in works correctly as a separate authentication method

2. User documentation updates to reflect the simplified authentication flow

3. App Store submission once testing is complete

## Conclusion
The app has been successfully transitioned from zkLogin to a more direct and secure wallet implementation with Face ID protection. This should provide a better user experience while maintaining strong security through biometric authentication.
