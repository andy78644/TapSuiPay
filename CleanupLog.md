# Cleanup Log - May 21, 2025

This file documents code cleanup during the refactoring from zkLogin to direct SuiKit wallet implementation.

## Files Removed

1. **MainView.swift**
   - Reason: Duplicate functionality. ContentView.swift is now the main UI entry point.
   - Status: Removed

2. **SUIZkLoginService.swift**
   - Reason: Replaced by WalletManager.swift for direct SuiKit wallet operations.
   - Status: Removed

3. **SUIBlockchainService.swift**
   - Reason: Replaced by TransactionService.swift and TapSuiPayService.swift.
   - Status: Removed

4. **SuiKitIntegration.swift**
   - Reason: Mock implementation no longer needed with direct SuiKit integration.
   - Status: Removed

5. **MockSuiKit.swift**
   - Reason: Mock implementation no longer needed with real SuiKit integration.
   - Status: Removed

## Code Updates

1. **ServiceContainer.swift**
   - Removed zkLoginService and blockchainService references
   - Removed legacy service initialization
   - Now only uses the new services: KeychainManager, WalletManager, TransactionService, TapSuiPayService, GoogleAuthService

2. **ContentView.swift**
   - Updated to work with the new services
   - Added Google sign-in button
   - Changed UI text from "zkLogin" to "Face ID" to reflect biometric authentication

3. **TransactionViewModel.swift**
   - Updated to use WalletManager instead of zkLoginService
   - Updated to use TransactionService instead of blockchainService
   - Implemented biometric authentication flow

## Additional Code Updates - May 21, 2025

1. **NFCService.swift**
   - Updated to use TransactionService and WalletManager instead of blockchainService and zkLoginService
   - Replaced authentication flow to use Face ID verification
   - Updated transaction execution and verification methods

2. **Configuration.swift**
   - Updated Auth struct to replace zkLogin storage keys with wallet-specific keys
   - Changed saltStorageKey to walletSecureData for mnemonic/wallet storage

3. **README.md**
   - Updated documentation to reflect Face ID authentication instead of zkLogin

## Dependencies

- All zkLogin specific dependencies have been reviewed and removed from the Podfile

## Impact Analysis

This cleanup:
- Reduces code complexity by removing redundant files
- Eliminates references to deprecated zkLogin patterns
- Ensures consistent use of Face ID authentication throughout the codebase
- Makes the wallet management and transaction flow more straightforward and secure
- Streamlines the app architecture by using direct SuiKit wallet operations
- Enhances security through local biometric authentication
- Makes Google authentication optional and separate from the blockchain operations
